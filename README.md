# public-portfolio-page
a public copy of my portfolio code without personal details

Here is the README that is available at my website:

> CODE PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE
> ======================

> Hello!

> If you'd like to see the code for my portfolio website, you are much better off going to:

> https://github.com/colleyc-osu/public-portfolio-page

> There are way too many files to elegantly include on this page. The above repo is a copy of my initial portfolio repo that I have since made private. I did so because I messed up the .gitignore, so it contained personal information that I didn't necessarily want just sitting for anyone to see on GitHub. As a result, you unfortunately won't be able to see the specific commits I made over the course of the project.

> Also included at the above link are design sketches that I made prior to actually building the project. Some details were not implemented for various reasons, and some were added, such as the Summary tab. One feature that I wanted to include but wasn't able to totally figure out is an actually interactable demo of my programs. When I figure it out, I am going to implement it, but for now the demos are shown as videos.
